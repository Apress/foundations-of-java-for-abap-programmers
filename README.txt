Some of these source files will run as is. Just copy them into your favorite IDE, compile them and run them. 

However, some of these file are ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. This means they will not run without other code being 
added, but they are templates to use to build your own code.

I recommend using Eclipse from www.eclipse.org to run these examples. I also recommend a separate project
for each group. (i.e. One for JCo, one for Swing etc.)

You will learn a lot by coding - you will not learn a lot by copying.
